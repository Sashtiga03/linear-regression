# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent Methods

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using various optimization techniques. The notebook includes:

- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**
- **Batch Gradient Descent**
- **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent**

Additionally, the notebook provides visualizations of different learning rates and convergence plots.

## Features
- **Multiple Gradient Descent Methods**: Implementations of batch, mini-batch, and stochastic gradient descent.
- **Convergence Analysis**: Plots to compare the effect of different learning rates on convergence.
- **Visualizations**: Graphical representations of the regression line and the convergence process.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `student_scores.csv`, which contains data on the number of hours studied and the corresponding scores achieved by students.

- **Columns**:
  - `Hours`: Number of hours studied.
  - `Scores`: Score achieved by the student.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, the following libraries are required:

```bash
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
